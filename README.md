🪴 Houseplant Store – Full-Stack E-Commerce Web App
An end-to-end e-commerce platform built for plant lovers, offering a smooth and intuitive shopping experience with a scalable architecture, responsive design, and clean UI. This project demonstrates full-stack proficiency by integrating a modern frontend with a robust backend and database system.

🎯 Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a scalable and responsive e-commerce platform for selling houseplants. It focuses on building real-world e-commerce functionality, including product browsing, filtering, cart management, and checkout preparation — all powered by a modular full-stack architecture.

🧠 Project Overview
The Houseplant Store project simulates a real-world online plant shop where users can:

Browse categorized plants

Add items to a cart

View total cost

Continue shopping or proceed to checkout

It leverages React.js for a dynamic frontend, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Express.js + MongoDB for backend API and data persistence. Tailwind CSS ensures a modern, responsive user interface.

✅ Solution Highlights
✔️ Built with React.js, Redux Toolkit, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
✔️ RESTful backend API using Express with Mongoose models
✔️ Responsive frontend UI using Tailwind CSS
✔️ Fully functional shopping cart with quantity management
✔️ Scalable and modular folder structure for professional development
✔️ Environment-safe setup with .env configurations
✔️ Optimized for deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Render, or Railway)
